# The Mathematical Findings of DDR Difficulty Calculators

Goal: To find out what makes a song in Dance Dance Revolution hard to score on

Process: The process took a total of eight weeks or sixteen hours to complete. This [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YCIQHmHyEqYVxfpS_oZpCO26jYfiLwXr8O0rxaybCsY/edit?usp=sharing) does a good job of documenting what occurred every week

Week 1- Introduction
The method for completing the project was fleshed out. 54 songs were chosen from the game that had the hardest difficulty, 18 and 19. This was so there would be enough score variance between the top players. The top fourteen players from the DDR ranking website plus the third place Konami Arcade Championship finalist would be evaluated for their scores. Data will be taken from Skill Attack or Twitter, whichever one provides more accurate scores.

Week 2- [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJwB6DM1Rgd7vcykuHsGiLuTWSulf_7CsIXnuPkISbw/edit?usp=sharing)
The “Song Information” tab was created, along with most of the columns. This intends to document every attribute of a song that could possibly contribute to its difficulty.

Week 3- Player data
Player data was added, which collects the scores from the fifteen top players mentioned above, plus what kind of combo they achieved. Their scores were then combined to form an average score for every song and player. Any scores left undocumented were left blank.

Week 4- User Information
The “User Information” tab was added, which went over the top players and some basic information about them. This tab was largely unused. More columns were added to the Song Information tab and the player scores were finalized.

Week 5- Ordered Data
The data taken from the first two slides were combined. Each column from Song Information was lined up and compared with the average score. Two scatter plots were made per column. One with a range of 925,000-1,000,00 and one with a range of 990,000-1,000,000 to better examine the data without the inclusion of the outliers that were given a 19 difficulty. The top two easiest and hardest ranges were documented

Week 6- Github
The (incomplete) findings were posted on Github with the intention to finish in the future. This was mostly learning how to use Github and how to clearly present the data in website format.

## Song Information column explanation
Song- The song’s title

ID- The song’s identification number, ordered by average score of the selected fifteen players

Length (seconds)- The song’s length in seconds

Notes- The amount of arrows, or notes, a song has. Does not count jumps or shock arrows

Freeze Arrows- Amount of hold arrows, which have a trail following them

Shock Arrows- Amount of rows of shock arrows, which are not meant to be stepped on and break the player's combo when stepped.

Jumps- Amount of jumps, portrayed by two arrows hitting the receptor at the same time

Peak BPM- Highest BPM a song reaches when at least one note is hit

Lowest BPM- Lowest BPM a song reaches when at least one note is hit

#of Stops- Number of times the stepchart stops moving

#BPM changes- Number of times the stepchart changes speed

Notes/Second- Number of notes divided by seconds

Year of Origin- Year the song was originally released to the game

#of Crossovers- Number of left-up-right, left-down-right, and vice versa step patterns

Difficulty- Difficulty rating given by Konami, the game’s developer. While the normal scale is 1-20, this project focuses on songs rated 18-19.

Air- Air value for a song given by Konami, used to calculate jumps

Avg score- Average score of fifteen selected players

FArrows PS- Freeze arrows divided by seconds

JPS- Jumps divided by seconds

CPS- Crossovers divided by seconds
